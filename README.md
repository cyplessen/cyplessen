# Hi there 👋

<br>

## Work

- 🔭 I’m currently doing my PhD on *Meta research and research synthesis on digital health interventions* at VU Amsterdam. I use and extend the method of **multiverse meta-analyses** to investigate the efficacy of digital health interventions.
- 🖥 I work at the **Psychometrics and Health Outcomes Lab** at Charité Berlin researching physical functioning and digital sovereignty in patients.

<br>

## Projects

👨‍💻 I’m currently working on:
- Multiverse meta-analysis by extentding them to different effect sizes and 3-level structures.
- A shiny app for displaying reference data. 
- Multigroup differential item functioning.
- Data management of databases containing information on RCTs for depression and anxiety.

Unfortuntately, most of my ongoing projects are under construction, so I am not yet able to share most repositories.
