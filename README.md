# Hi there 👋

<br>

## Work

- 🔭 I’m currently doing my PhD on *Meta research and research synthesis on digital health interventions* at VU Amsterdam. 
- 🖥 I’m a researcher at the [**Psychometrics and Health Outcomes Lab**](http://patient-centered-outcomes-research.org/) at Charité Berlin focussing on item response theory based patient reported outcomes measures for physical functioning and pain.

<br>

## Projects

👨‍💻 I’m currently working on:
- Investigating the robustness of the evidence for digital mental health interventions for common mental health disorders using a multiverse meta-analysis approach.
- I develop a shiny app for displaying reference data based on quantile regression and plausible value imputation. 
- Multiverse differential item functioning analyses.
- Meta-Analytic Research Domain (MARD) management for RCTs on depression, anxiety, and PTSD.

Unfortuntately, most of my ongoing projects are under construction, so I am not yet able to share most repositories.
